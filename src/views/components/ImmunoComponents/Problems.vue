          <ul>
            <li>Autoimmune diseases are being diagnosed with such frequency that some medical experts are calling it an epidemic.</li>
            <li>50 million Americans suffer from an autoimmune related disease (according to AARDA*).</li>
            <li>Autoimmunity is now one of the most common disease categories, ahead of cancer and heart disease.</li>
            <li>It is now one of the top 10 leading causes of death in female children and women.</li>
            <li>Unlike cancer, thereâ€™s no central database to help researchers understand how many people are affected, where cases are occurring and how incidences are rising.</li>
